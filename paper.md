# Summary

As per a survey 78% of organisations have open source programs established. 96%
of the scanned projects use open source componets in commercial and non commercial
projects. First open source software was release in 1998, since past 21 years
open source has gradually increased changing and touching lives of people all
around the world in direct or indirect way. In this study we have studied top 19
organisations in terms of number of users and contributors. We are releasing a
one website where open source program managers and contributors can know open
source as one unit. This study is a exposition of demographics of open source
organisation in terms of maintainers, users, external contributors. We have also
studied the project management aka managerial activities like labelling of tickets,
release per cycle, public planning, fundings and public investments done by the
organisation in open source. This study also sheds light on communication practices
established in open source organisations using NLP and ML algorithms. We have coined
a term called Openness Rank. This study includes free and open source organisations
and open source organisations.
